## What are the key differences between this and Colonel_Mortis' Unofficial LTT Notifier?

Here are some of the differences:
* We've updated the TimeAgo plugin to the latest version
* We've updated to the latest version of FontAwesome
* We've updated to the latest version of jQuery
* This extension is compatible with Modern Web Browsers like FireFox 60+ since it was re-designed for it.
