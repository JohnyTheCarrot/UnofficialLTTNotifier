# UnofficialLTTNotifier
An unofficial LTT Notifier browser extension.

## About
This is an unofficial notifier browser extension for the Linus Tech Tips Forum.

We are not affiliated with or associated with Linus Media Group Inc or Floatplane Inc.
This is 100% unofficial and is created and maintained by fans.

This project is "Free Software" and is built for people and not for financial gain or profit.

Here is the Free Software Foundation's definition of "Free Software":
>  “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community.
Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,”
not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom,
 to show we do not mean the software is gratis.

> We campaign for these freedoms because everyone deserves them. With these freedoms,
 the users (both individually and collectively) control the program and what it does for them.
  When users don't control the program, we call it a “nonfree” or “proprietary” program.
   The nonfree program controls the users, and the developer controls the program;
    this makes the program an instrument of unjust power.

> The four essential freedoms

> A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms:

>    The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
    The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
    The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
    The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## What are the key differences between this and Colonel_Mortis' Unofficial LTT Notifier?

Here are some of the differences:
* We've updated the TimeAgo plugin to the latest version
* We've updated to the latest version of FontAwesome
* We've updated to the latest version of jQuery
* This extension is compatible with Modern Web Browsers like FireFox 60+ since it was re-designed for it.
